* The Beauty of Retro Web Design

There's something charming about early web design that modern sites often lack.

** What Made Early Web Special?

- *Simplicity*: No JavaScript frameworks, just HTML and basic CSS
- *Personality*: Geocities, Angelfire sites showed individual creativity
- *Performance*: Pages loaded instantly on dial-up connections

** Design Elements We Miss

** Grey Backgrounds
The classic #C0C0C0 background was the canvas of choice.

** Blue Links
Unvisited links in blue (#0000FF), visited in magenta (#800080).

** Inset Borders
Those beveled borders created depth and dimension.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<table border="2" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
      <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">
        Retro content here
      </font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
#+END_SRC

** Why Bring It Back?

1. *Readability*: Clean typography without distractions
2. *Accessibility*: Works on any browser, even text-only ones
3. *Focus*: Content over chrome and animations

The retro web reminds us that sometimes simpler is better.
