* Hugo and Static Site Generation

Static site generators have revolutionized how we build websites. Hugo is one of the fastest available.

** What Makes Hugo Special?

- *Speed*: Built in Go, Hugo builds sites in milliseconds
- *Simplicity*: No database required, just markdown/org files
- *Flexibility*: Multiple content formats and themes

** Hugo Commands

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Create a new site
hugo new site my-blog

# Create a new post  
hugo new content posts/my-post.org

# Run development server
hugo server --buildDrafts

# Build for production
hugo
#+END_SRC

** Benefits of Static Sites

1. *Security*: No server-side processing or databases
2. *Performance*: Serve pre-built HTML files
3. *Cheap Hosting*: Can host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

** Content Management

With Hugo, content is king. Write in org-mode, markdown, or other formats, and Hugo handles the rest. The separation of content and presentation makes everything cleaner.
